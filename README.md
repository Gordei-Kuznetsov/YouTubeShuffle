# YouTubeShuffle

Does your YouTube playlist not shuffle properly? Do you have problems listening to the playlist of your favourite 1000 songs in random order instead of a closed loop of just about 12 of them? 
YouTubeShuffle is a Google Chrome Extension built to transparently shuffle your playlist in random order using the existing controls on the YouTube page.
